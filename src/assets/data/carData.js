The system can accurately measure the weight of a single axle or multiple axles in a train. It is composed of a central processing unit, sensors, a power supply, and a communication interface. The system records data on the load on each axle in real-time and transmits it to the central processing unit. The data can be used to identify problems and determine whether a train is overloaded or underloaded. The system can also be used to detect potential safety issues, such as when a vehicleâ€™s load is outside of its design limits.",
